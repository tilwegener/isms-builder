> ## ⚠️ Security Warning: Fake repositories and copies distributing malware
> ISMS Builder has **no packaged "releases", installers, or downloadable ZIP files** — the only
> legitimate source is this repository, cloned or downloaded directly from GitHub as plain
> source code. We are aware of at least one **malicious repository impersonating this project**
> (fake README, fake "Download" button linking to a ZIP disguised as a screenshot, containing a
> Windows malware loader — `.cmd` → `.exe` → Lua-DLL payload chain). **Do not download or run any
> "isms_builder" ZIP/installer/exe from anywhere other than this repository.**
> If you find a suspicious repo or site impersonating this project, please open an
> [issue](https://github.com/coolstartnow/isms-builder/issues) or a
> [discussion](https://github.com/coolstartnow/isms-builder/discussions) so we can flag it.

> **Status: Active development — not yet a finished product.**
> The core modules are functional and in use, but some features are incomplete
> and the platform is still growing. Contributions, feedback and real-world
> testing are very welcome — that is exactly why this was open-sourced.

## What is ISMS Builder?

ISMS Builder is a **self-hosted web platform** for managing an Information Security Management System (ISMS).
It covers the full compliance lifecycle — from policy authoring to audit evidence — for ISO 27001:2022, NIS2, GDPR/DSGVO, BSI IT-Grundschutz and other frameworks.

**No cloud. No SaaS fees. Your data stays on your server.**

> Designed for SMEs, IT teams, and consultants who need a real ISMS tool without a five-figure vendor contract.

### ⚠ IMPORTANT: ISO Controls Require Manual Installation by the Administrator

> **ISO 27001:2022, ISO 9000:2015, and ISO 9001:2015** are copyright-protected standards published
> by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO, © ISO). The control definitions
> (titles, descriptions, requirement text) are **not included** in this software and must **not**
> be redistributed without a valid ISO licence.

**What this means in practice:**
The SoA modules for ISO 27001, ISO 9000, and ISO 9001 ship without control content.
The administrator **must manually import** the controls before these frameworks are usable:

1. Obtain a licensed copy of the standard from [iso.org](https://www.iso.org/) or an authorised national body
2. Prepare a JSON file with your control definitions (format documented in `scripts/import-iso-controls.sh`)
3. Run the import script:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/import-iso-controls.sh path/to/iso-controls.json
   ```
4. Restart the ISMS Builder server

> **Frameworks included out-of-the-box (no ISO licence required):**
> BSI IT-Grundschutz, EU NIS2, EUCS, EU AI Act, and CRA are based on publicly available
> EU legislation and German federal publications and are fully pre-installed.

Operating the ISO framework modules without a valid licence for the respective standard is the
sole responsibility of the operator. The ISMS Builder project and its contributors accept no
liability for unlicensed use of ISO-protected content.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coolstartnow/isms-builder.git
cd isms-builder
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # set JWT_SECRET to a long random string
npm start                     # http://localhost:3000
```

Login with **`admin@example.com` / `adminpass`**. On first login you will be prompted to choose your **demo data language** (🇩🇪 DE / 🇬🇧 EN / 🇫🇷 FR / 🇳🇱 NL) or start with an empty system. Change the admin password immediately after.

For production use with HTTPS:

```bash
# .env
JWT_SECRET=your-very-long-random-secret
STORAGE_BACKEND=json
SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/ssl/certs/your.crt
SSL_KEY_FILE=/etc/ssl/private/your.key
```

**Going live after evaluating with demo data?** Run the interactive production-prep tool instead
of starting from a fresh install — it clears demo/test content module by module (or all at once),
so any real data you've already entered (e.g. risks, assets) doesn't have to be re-entered:

```bash
bash stop.sh
node scripts/prepare-production.js
bash start.sh
```

It always creates a backup (`data.bak.<timestamp>/`, next to your `data/` directory) before
changing anything, and never touches `STORAGE_BACKEND` — unlike the in-app "Demo Reset" admin
action, which is meant for the demo instance and still switches to `sqlite` for historical reasons
(see [Issue #42](https://github.com/coolstartnow/isms-builder/issues/42)).

---

## Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
# App runs at http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+** (tested: 18, 20, 22)
- npm 9+
- (Optional) Docker + Docker Compose
- (Optional) [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) for local AI semantic search

---

## Configuration (`.env`)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `JWT_SECRET` | *(required)* | Secret for JWT signing — use 32+ random characters |
| `PORT` | `3000` | HTTP/HTTPS listen port |
| `STORAGE_BACKEND` | `json` | `json` (dev/demo) or `sqlite` (production) |
| `SSL_CERT_FILE` | — | Path to TLS certificate → enables HTTPS |
| `SSL_KEY_FILE` | — | Path to TLS private key |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Override data directory (Docker volumes) |
| `SMTP_HOST` | — | SMTP server for email alerts |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `587` | SMTP port |
| `SMTP_USER` | — | SMTP username |
| `SMTP_PASS` | — | SMTP password |
| `SMTP_FROM` | — | Sender address for notifications |

## Architecture

```
server/
  index.js          — Express app setup, router mounts
  auth.js           — JWT auth, RBAC ranks, session
  routes/           — 17 Express route modules (one per domain)
  db/               — Data stores (jsonStore / sqliteStore / orgSettingsStore / …)
  ai/               — Semantic search (embedder, embeddingStore, lexicalSearch)
  reports.js        — Report generation logic
ui/
  index.html        — SPA shell (Atlassian Dark Theme)
  app.js            — All render functions, ~6000 lines vanilla JS
  style.css         — CSS variables, dark theme
data/               — JSON files / SQLite DB (gitignored)
docs/
  ISMS-build-documentation.md  — Full architecture reference
  architecture/                — C4 diagrams, data model, OpenAPI 3.0.3 spec
tests/              — Jest + Supertest (176 tests, --runInBand)
```

- **Auth:** JWT cookie (`sm_session`), bcrypt passwords, TOTP 2FA (enforceable org-wide)
- **RBAC:** `reader` → `editor` / `dept_head` → `contentowner` / `auditor` → `admin`
- **Persistence:** JSON files (default/demo) or SQLite via `better-sqlite3`
- **AI:** Optional local Ollama (nomic-embed-text); keyword search always available as fallback
- **Audit Log:** Every create/update/delete/login action recorded, filterable, exportable

See [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/) for C4 diagrams, full data model, and OpenAPI 3.0.3 spec (80+ endpoints).

## Running Tests

> **Note:** The test suite under `tests/` is the author's personal development tests and is
> shipped alongside the project for transparency. It is **not** part of the application itself
> and is **not required** to run the app. The tests cover internal API behaviour and use
> hardcoded test credentials that only exist in the isolated test environment — they have no
> relation to any production or demo data.

```bash
npm test                  # runs all 265 tests
npm test -- --verbose     # with test names
```

Tests use an isolated temp directory — no production data is touched.

## About the Author

**Claude Hecker** has been working in IT for over 35 years. After roughly 15 years as CIO,
he transitioned into the roles of CISO and Data Protection Officer (DSO/DSB). During his career
he has designed and implemented enterprise-wide IT infrastructure and wide-area network connectivity
(VPN, MPLS) for a major European corporation — responsible for reliable, secure operations across
multiple sites and jurisdictions.

ISMS Builder grew directly out of that experience: building and maintaining a compliant ISMS in the
real world, across real audits, with real regulatory pressure. The tool reflects what practitioners
actually need — not what a product manager thinks they need.

**Why open source?**
SMEs deserve access to a proper ISMS platform without five-figure licence fees. The onboarding effort
is real regardless of which tool you choose — but that cost should not be compounded by vendor
lock-in or data leaving your own infrastructure. This project stands for software freedom and the
principle that your compliance data belongs to you.
